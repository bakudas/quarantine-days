"LS1.C-2": [ "Plants acquire their material for growth chiefly from air and water." ],
"LS1.D-1": [ "Different sense receptors are specialized for particular kinds of information, which may be then processed by the animal’s brain. Animals are able to use their perceptions and memories to guide their actions." ],
"LS2.A-1a": [ "The food of almost any kind of animal can be traced back to plants. Organisms are related in food webs in which some animals eat plants for food and other animals eat the animals that eat plants. Some organisms, such as fungi and bacteria, break down dead organisms (both plants or plants parts and animals) and therefore operate as “decomposers.” Decomposition eventually restores (recycles) some materials back to the soil. Organisms can survive only in environments in which their particular needs are met. A healthy ecosystem is one in which multiple species of different types are each able to meet their needs in a relatively stable web of life. Newly introduced species can damage the balance of an ecosystem." ],

"LS2.B-1": [ "Matter cycles between the air and soil and among plants, animals, and microbes as these organisms live and die. Organisms obtain gases, and water, from the environment, and release waste matter (gas, liquid, or solid) back into the environment." ],
"LS2.C-1": [ "When the environment changes in ways that affect a place’s physical characteristics, temperature, or availability of resources, some organisms survive and reproduce, others move to new locations, yet others move into the transformed environment, and some die." ],
"LS2.D-1": [ "Being part of a group helps animals obtain food, defend themselves, and cope with changes. Groups may serve different functions and vary dramatically in size." ],
"LS3.A-1": [ "Many characteristics of organisms are inherited from their parents." ],
"LS3.A-2": [ "Other characteristics result from individuals’ interactions with the environment, which can range from diet to learning. Many characteristics involve both inheritance and environment." ],
"LS3.B-1": [ "Different organisms vary in how they look and function because they have different inherited information." ],
"LS3.B-2": [ "The environment also affects the traits that an organism develops." ],
"LS4.A-1": [ "Some kinds of plants and animals that once lived on Earth are no longer found anywhere." ],
"LS4.A-2": [ "Fossils provide evidence about the types of organisms that lived long ago and also about the nature of their environments." ],
"LS4.B-1": [ "Sometimes the differences in characteristics between individuals of the same species provide advantages in surviving, finding mates, and reproducing." ],
"LS4.C-1": [ "For any particular environment, some kinds of organisms survive well, some survive less well, and some cannot survive at all." ],
"LS4.D-1": [ "Populations live in a variety of habitats, and change in those habitats affects the organisms living there." ],

"PS1.A-1": [ "Matter of any type can be subdivided into particles that are too small to see, but even then the matter still exists and can be detected by other means. A model showing that gases are made from matter particles that are too small to see and are moving freely around in space can explain many observations, including the inflation and shape of a balloon and the effects of air on larger particles or objects." ],
"PS1.A-2": [ "The amount (weight) of matter is conserved when it changes form, even in transitions in which it seems to vanish." ],
"PS1.A-3": [ "Measurements of a variety of properties can be used to identify materials. (Boundary: At this grade level, mass and weight are not distinguished, and no attempt is made to define the unseen particles or explain the atomic-scale mechanism of evaporation and condensation.)" ],
"PS1.B-1": [ "When two or more different substances are mixed, a new substance with different properties may be formed." ],
"PS1.B-2": [ "No matter what reaction or change in properties occurs, the total weight of the substances does not change. (Boundary: Mass and weight are not distinguished at this grade level.)" ],
"PS2.A-1": [ "Each force acts on one particular object and has both strength and a direction. An object at rest typically has multiple forces acting on it, but they add to give zero net force on the object. Forces that do not sum to zero can cause changes in the object’s speed or direction of motion. (Boundary: Qualitative and conceptual, but not quantitative addition of forces are used at this level.)" ],
"PS2.A-2": [ "The patterns of an object’s motion in various situations can be observed and measured; when that past motion exhibits a regular pattern, future motion can be predicted from it. (Boundary: Technical terms, such as magnitude, velocity, momentum, and vector quantity, are not introduced at this level, but the concept that some quantities need both size and direction to be described is developed.)" ],
"PS2.B-1": [ "Objects in contact exert forces on each other." ],
"PS2.B-2": [ "Electric, and magnetic forces between a pair of objects do not require that the objects be in contact. The sizes of the forces in each situation depend on the properties of the objects and their distances apart and, for forces between two magnets, on their orientation relative to each other." ],
"PS2.B-3": [ "The gravitational force of Earth acting on an object near Earth’s surface pulls that object toward the planet’s center." ],
"PS3.A-1": [ "The faster a given object is moving, the more energy it possesses." ],
"PS3.A-2": [ "Energy can be moved from place to place by moving objects or through sound, light, or electric currents." ],
"PS3.B-1": [ "Energy is present whenever there are moving objects, sound, light, or heat. When objects collide, energy can be transferred from one object to another, thereby changing their motion. In such collisions, some energy is typically also transferred to the surrounding air; as a result, the air gets heated and sound is produced." ],
"PS3.B-2": [ "Light also transfers energy from place to place." ],
"PS3.B-3": [ "Energy can also be transferred from place to place by electric currents, which can then be used locally to produce motion, sound, heat, or light. The currents may have been produced to begin with by transforming the energy of motion into electrical energy." ],
"PS3.C-1": [ "When objects collide, the contact forces transfer energy so as to change the objects’ motions." ],
"PS3.D-1": [ "The expression “produce energy” typically refers to the conversion of stored energy into a desired form for practical use." ],
"PS3.D-2": [ "The energy released [from] food was once energy from the sun that was captured by plants in the chemical process that forms plant matter (from air and water)." ],
"PS4.A-1": [ "Waves, which are regular patterns of motion, can be made in water by disturbing the surface. When waves move across the surface of deep water, the water goes up and down in place; there is no net motion in the direction of the wave except when the water meets a beach." ],
"PS4.A-2": [ "Waves of the same type can differ in amplitude (height of the wave) and wavelength (spacing between wave peaks)." ],
"PS4.B-1": [ "An object can be seen when light reflected from its surface enters the eyes." ],
"PS4.C-1": [ "Digitized information can be transmitted over long distances without significant degradation. High-tech devices, such as computers or cell phones, can receive and decode information—convert it from digitized form to voice—and vice versa." ]
